For our compromised customers and our customers wishing to avoid contact during this time, we are offering a delivery option that will put your product in the original boxes and packaging, at your front door, garage or patio.  To schedule No-Contact delivery, you can work with our delivery department when they follow up with scheduling your delivery.\n \n<br>\n<h2>Our Delivery Process<\/h2>\nYour salesperson will work with you on scheduling your delivery, based on the delivery schedule for your area. Orders typically deliver within 3-10 days from purchase. Changes in inventory or delivery capacity, as well as unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, such as a strike, natural disaster, or inclement weather, may delay delivery of your order.  Please note that we require a minimum of a 72-hour notice for any changes to your sales order before delivery. A few days before your scheduled delivery, a store representative will be calling you to confirm the delivery address and the merchandise that you have purchased.  The evening before or the morning of your delivery, our delivery team will call you with a four-hour delivery window. <br><br>\nWhen our delivery team arrives, you can expect a very professional experience.  We ask that you please have the area cleared where your new furniture is to be placed so that our delivery team can position your furniture to your liking.  We always remove packing materials, so you can enjoy your new furniture immediately! <br><br>\nWe are all about safety and want to make sure that not only our delivery team has a safe working environment, but your new furniture is positioned safely in your home (without any damage).  Please discuss any difficult delivery possibilities with your salesperson at the time of scheduling, so that we can ensure a great delivery.  Deliveries can be made to the third floor (or two flights of stairs) permitting staircase wide enough for furniture. For deliveries above the third floor (or two flights of stairs) elevator access will be required to complete delivery.",
